## Quick Install 

Check [releases](https://github.com/watislaf/chessbot/releases), and download latest ChessBot.zip(board and bot) or Engine.zip (board only). And run it with Run instructions 

### Features
* 64 bit board representation. 
* The code is divided into three parts: self-written chess engine in C++, board
  visualisation and computer vision on python.
* The code was optimized by blood and sweat to keep your computer from exploding
  during chess game.
* After you build the project , there is an uninstall script, to remove all
  redundant libraries (and the project ðŸ¥²).
* You can Build only on Linux so that's +1 (one more) reason to
  install linux.
* asm insert code

## Development status

My goal waas 2000 ELO on chess.com, and still i'm not banned (ok iam banned but it is only because of my insolence), so i think this is sukces.

## Build 

Download source files.

```bat
  git clone https://github.com/watislaf/chessbot.git # install
  cd ./chessbot
```
if you don't have git, just download source from [this page](https://github.com/watislaf/chessbot/releases/tag/V1.0.1600Elo).

Next, there is a small script to build the project.

If you don't need the bot part, but want a taste of a losing game in chess,
press No, so the OpenCv library will not be downloaded.

```bat
  bash ./setup.sh    
  cd ./dir
```
 Build the project, answer No only if you do not Bot version, now there is an .zip that u can unpack.
 

## Run

To run a board-game:

```bat
    ./ChessBot  --mode=board 
                --white_player=[human|engine] # default is human
                --black_player=[human|engine] # default is engine
                --lvl=[easy|bullet|blitz|rapid]  # 0,1,3,10 min games. default is bullet
```

Or to run the second mode (only if you pressed Yes in setup.sh script). Check settings.png file with your chess.com settings.

```bat
    ./ChessBot --mode=chesscom                 
                --level=[bullet|blitz|rapid]  
```

## Reinstall and uninstall (only if source was code downloaded)

If you pressed No, but changed your mind, type

```bat
  bash ./setup.sh reinstall 
```
Here you can answer Yes again.

## Uninstall
It is also possible to uninstall the script (and all downloaded with this
project libraries).   

```bat
  bash ./unis.sh  
```
